## 🔎 Functionality Breakdown

### 📤 PDF Upload & Text Extraction
- Extracts full text using `PyMuPDF`
- Stores the plain text for downstream tasks

### 🧩 Text Chunking
- Chunks long documents intelligently to handle model input size limits
- Keeps context and sentence boundaries intact

### 🧠 Summarization
- Uses `facebook/bart-large-cnn` to summarize long-form academic text
- Automatically merges summaries into one human-friendly response

### 🧬 Semantic Embedding & Vector Search
- Embeds chunks using `MiniLM`
- Uses FAISS to retrieve most relevant text blocks for a query

### 🤖 Q&A Engine
- Retrieves top context chunks
- Applies `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` to answer natural-language questions

---

## 🖥️ User Interface

Built with **Gradio**, the app provides:

- 📤 Upload button for PDF input
- 🧠 "Summarize" button with progress tracking
- ❓ Question input for real-time Q&A
- 📄 Display boxes for summary and answers

---

## 📦 Installation

### 🔧 Requirements

Python ≥ 3.9, pip

### 💻 Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-paper-assistant
cd research-paper-assistant
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
````

### ✅ Run on Colab

Just paste the script into [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and run — no setup needed.

### 🌐 Deploy on Hugging Face

* Create a new [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
